Privacy Policy for فەرهەنگی ناوی کوردی (Kurdish Names Dictionary)

Last updated: 17 November 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how ZanaLabs (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the mobile application فەرهەنگی ناوی کوردی (Kurdish Names Dictionary) (“the App” or “the Service”).

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


1. Overview

We collect only the minimum data needed to:

run the App,

understand how people use it,

improve name search and popularity features, and

keep the Service secure and reliable.

We do not sell your data and we do not use it to build advertising profiles.

This policy explains:

what data we collect,

how we use and share it,

how long we keep it,

your choices and rights, and

how to contact us.

2. Data We Collect

When you use the App, we may collect the following types of data.

2.1 Anonymous identifiers

Anonymous ID
A random ID (UUID) is generated and stored on your device, then synced to Firebase. We use it to associate your usage with a pseudonymous profile (not your real identity).

Hashed device ID (optional)
If used, the raw device identifier is salted and hashed on your device before it is sent to our servers. We never store the raw device ID. This helps with fraud prevention and diagnostics.

2.2 App usage and interaction data

App usage metrics
For example: how many times you open the App, when it was last opened, and events such as shortlisting.

Search and filter inputs
We may log search queries (sometimes trimmed or hashed), selected filters (e.g. gender, starting letter, length), and pagination events. This helps us understand which features are useful and where to improve search relevance.

Shortlisted / liked names
Your favourites and likes are stored as part of the App’s normal functionality and may also be counted in aggregated statistics (for example, to show popular names).

Suggestion and contribution metadata
If you submit a new name or suggest a change, we store the submission plus your anonymous ID for moderation and follow-up.

2.3 Location and technical data

Coarse location (country / region / city)
We derive an approximate location from your network connection on your device, then send only the coarse region strings (e.g. country code, region, city) to Firebase. We do not store full IP addresses or precise GPS location.

Technical diagnostics
Device OS version, App version, error codes, and basic performance metrics (e.g. connection failures, offline/online status) used for debugging and reliability.

2.4 Contact and support data

Support communications
If you contact us by email or other channels, we receive the information you choose to share (e.g. your email address, message content). We use it only to answer your questions and resolve issues.

3. What We Do Not Collect

We intentionally avoid collecting sensitive or directly identifying data.

Specifically, we do not:

store full IP addresses (only coarse location derived on device is sent),

collect precise location such as GPS or Wi-Fi coordinates,

collect your name, phone number, or other personal identifiers unless you voluntarily send them in a support message,

access your contacts, photos, microphone, or camera.

4. How We Use Your Data (and Legal Bases)

We use the data described above for the following purposes:

Provide and maintain the Service

Keep the App running, show your favourites, and respond to your actions (e.g. search, shortlist).

Legal basis: performance of a contract / legitimate interest.

Improve the App

Understand which features are used, improve search results, and prioritize new features.

Legal basis: legitimate interest (improving and operating our Service).

Regional insights and popularity rankings

Show popular names by country/region using aggregated like/shortlist counts.

Legal basis: legitimate interest; data is aggregated and pseudonymized.

Security and abuse prevention

Detect suspicious behaviour (e.g. automated abuse) using hashed device identifiers and aggregate statistics.

Legal basis: legitimate interest (protecting the Service and users).

Legal compliance

Keep records required by law and respond to valid legal requests.

Legal basis: legal obligation.

Where local law requires consent for analytics or non-essential data collection (for example, in parts of the EU/EEA/UK), we will rely on your explicit consent given through the first-launch dialog or in-app settings before enabling those analytics.

5. Data Sharing and Service Providers

We do not sell or rent your personal data.

We may share data with:

Firebase and Google Cloud (infrastructure and analytics)
We use Google Firebase (e.g. Firestore, anonymous authentication, optional Crashlytics/Analytics) to store and process data. Google acts as our data processor under the Firebase Data Processing Terms and may not use the data for its own purposes.

Other service providers
Carefully selected providers that help us with infrastructure, analytics, or support tooling. They are contractually required to process data only on our instructions and to protect it appropriately.

We may also disclose data if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to:

comply with a law, regulation, or court order,

protect the rights, property, or safety of ZanaLabs, our users, or others, or

detect, prevent, or address fraud or security issues.

If we are involved in a merger or acquisition, we may transfer user data to the new owner, who will continue to honour this Privacy Policy or notify you of changes.

6. Data Retention

We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes described above. In particular:

User documents (users/{anonymousId})
Stored until you reset analytics, delete the App (which generates a new anonymous ID if reinstalled), or request deletion.

Event logs (e.g. app_open_events, search and shortlist actions)
Retained for up to 48 months, then deleted using manual cleanup or automated scripts as they become available.

Support communications
Kept as long as needed to resolve your issue and for up to one additional year, then deleted.

We may retain certain information for longer periods if required by law or to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

7. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have some or all of the following rights:

Opt-out of analytics
If provided in the App, you can toggle off analytics so that only data strictly necessary for core functionality is collected.

Reset analytics data
If supported, you can use the “Reset analytics data” feature in the App to delete your stored analytics profile and related events, after which a new anonymous ID will be generated.

Access and deletion
You can contact us to request access to the data associated with your anonymous ID or to request deletion. We may ask for reasonable information to verify that you control the relevant device or profile.

Withdraw consent
Where we rely on consent (for example, for analytics in jurisdictions that require it), you can withdraw that consent at any time via in-app settings or by contacting us. This will not affect processing that has already taken place.

To exercise these rights, please email us at kurdishnamesdic@gmail.com
. We will respond as required by applicable law.

8. Security

We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your data, including:

using Firebase Security Rules to limit writes to the document linked to your anonymous ID,

encrypting data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (Firebase’s built-in encryption),

limiting access to backend systems to authorised personnel only.

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

9. International Data Transfers

Our infrastructure providers (such as Firebase) may store and process data on servers located outside your country.

When we transfer data internationally, we rely on appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses and our providers’ data-protection commitments, to protect your information.

10. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13.

We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. If we learn that we have collected such data without appropriate consent, we will delete it promptly.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as the App evolves.

When we make material changes, we will:

update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page, and

notify you through the App (for example, via an in-app message or release notes).

If you continue to use the App after changes take effect, you are deemed to have accepted the updated Policy.
