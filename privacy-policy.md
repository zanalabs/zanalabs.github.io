# Kurdish Names Dictionary – Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 14 November 2025  
**Last updated:** 14 November 2025

Kurdish Names Dictionary ("we", "our", "the app") is created and maintained by Zana Labs. We try to collect as little information as possible. This page explains:

- what we collect
- how we use it
- how long we keep it
- how you can contact us

---

## 1. What we collect

### 1.1 Anonymous usage information
When you use the app, we collect anonymous statistics such as:

- how often a name is liked or shortlisted
- how often the app is opened
- which features are used (for example, viewing meanings or using search)

We also use your device language and region (for example `ku-IQ`, `en-AU`) to understand which names are popular in different places.

These statistics are stored only as totals (counters). We do **not** attach your name, email, account, or device ID to them. We don’t know which specific person liked which name – we only know, for example, “this name was liked 123 times from this language/region”.

### 1.2 Suggestions you send us ("My suggestions")
If you suggest a new name, add a meaning, or suggest that a name is unisex, we store:

- the text you submitted (name, meaning, references, etc.)
- when it was submitted
- simple technical info like app version, language, and platform

To show your own suggestions back to you in the “My suggestions” section, the app uses an internal anonymous identifier that stays on your device. This lets us know which device created which suggestion so we can show it to you again.

We do not ask for your real name or email in the suggestion form, and we do not use this internal identifier for advertising or analytics.

### 1.3 Contact & support messages
If you use the “Contact us” form, we collect:

- the message you write
- basic technical info (for example, device type, app version, language/region)
- optional email address, only if you choose to provide it and tick the checkbox that lets us use it to reply

If you don’t tick the checkbox, your email is not stored and we can’t reply, but we can still read your feedback anonymously.

### 1.4 Ads (AdMob) and crash reports
**Ads** – The app shows banner ads using Google AdMob. AdMob’s SDK may collect information such as:

- device identifiers
- approximate location
- IP address
- which ads you see and tap

This is handled by Google’s systems to show and measure ads. You can control personalised ads using your device’s ad settings (Android/iOS) and any consent screens shown in the app.

**Crash reports** – We may use Firebase Crashlytics (or similar tools) to understand when the app crashes. Crash reports can include:

- device model and operating system
- app version and language
- technical details of the error (stack trace)

Crash reports are used only to fix bugs and improve stability. They do not include the names or meanings you type into the app.

---

## 2. What we do not collect
We deliberately do not collect:

- your real name, address, or phone number
- your contacts, photos, microphone, or camera data
- GPS location or Wi-Fi location
- detailed IP address logs in our own database
- a login account for normal users (no username/password)

We also do not create advertising profiles based on what names you view or shortlist inside the app.

---

## 3. How we use your information
We use the information described above to:

- **Run the app** – show you Kurdish names and meanings, let you like and shortlist names, and keep your suggestions visible in “My suggestions”.
- **Improve the app** – see which names and features are used most (anonymously) and decide what to improve or add next.
- **Moderate suggestions** – review and approve/reject suggested names and meanings, and keep a basic history of what has been changed.
- **Help you when you ask for support** – read and respond to messages sent via the contact form, fix bugs, and understand problems you report.
- **Show ads and fix crashes** – display banner ads via AdMob and analyse crash reports to improve stability.

We do not sell your data.

---

## 4. How long we keep information

- **Anonymous usage statistics** – kept indefinitely as aggregated counters that aren’t linked to individuals.
- **Suggestions** – kept with their moderation history as part of the dictionary’s change log.
- **Support messages and emails** – kept until your issue is resolved, then for up to one year. We delete them sooner if you ask.
- **Ads and crash logs** – stored by Google AdMob and Crashlytics according to their policies; we don’t control those retention periods.

---

## 5. Children’s privacy
The app is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information (such as email addresses) from children under 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data through the app, please contact us and we will delete it as soon as we can.

---

## 6. Where data is stored and who helps us
We use services provided by Google Firebase and Google AdMob to host and operate the app. That means some data may be stored or processed on servers outside your country (for example, in the EU or US).

These services provide storage, authentication, crash reporting, and advertising. They have their own privacy and security protections and do not act on our instructions for anything beyond running these features.

We do not run our own data centres.

---

## 7. Your choices
You have a few simple choices:

- **Suggestions and support messages** – contact us and ask us to update or delete this data where it’s reasonable and technically possible.
- **Email in the support form** – decide whether to share an email address. If you don’t tick the consent checkbox, we don’t store it.
- **Ads and tracking** – use your device’s settings (Android/iOS) to limit personalised ads or reset your advertising ID. Any in-app consent prompts for ads will be respected.

If you have questions or concerns about how your data is handled, you can always reach out to us.

---

## 8. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy when we add features or change how the app works. The “Last updated” date at the top shows when the most recent change was made. If we make significant changes, we may show a short notice inside the app or in the store listing.
